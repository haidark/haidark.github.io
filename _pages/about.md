My research interests are mainly focused around machine learning on time series data. Previously, I worked on applying machine learning to medical time series. Recently, I have begun working on natural language understanding problems.

I completed my PhD with the Data Science Research Center (DSRC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). My work with Prof. BÃ¼lent Yener focused on developing methods specially designed for classifying, predicting, and analyzing medical data. We worked in collaboration with a team of doctors from the Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. 

Alongside my research with the DSRC, I have worked as a researcher with a number of tech companies. As an intern at IBM Research for two summers, I explored the scalability limitations of existing parallel training algorithms for deep neural networks on IBM's HPC and developed communication schemes to circumvent those limitations. Recently, I worked with Siemens Corporate Technology to develop methods to parallelize the training of multiagent reinforcement learning systems.
