    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this series of articles on Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of this series is to develop an understanding of current approaches in NLP. We will be covering a wide range of topics with the goal of getting practical experience in building models for each topic. The focus will be on text based NLP, excluding any type of speech recognition from from audio. Each article will be a combination of the mathematical background and description of the approach as well as a practical code example. Code will be written in Tensorflow or PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main approaches covered in this series will be the popular and effective deep learning approaches, although classical approaches may be ocassionally referenced. In this series, emphasis will be placed on building intuition and introducing the essence of methods. A basic understanding of machine learning and linear algebra is assumed. Example of topics that will be covered are word representations, sentiment classification, machine translation, and article classification. \n",

    "## References\n",
    "The original papers for each method will be referenced whenever possible. \n",

    "## Words as vectors\n",
    "Vectors are the basic building blocks of most mathematical and machine learning models. They provide a convenient way to represent objects, their relationships, and operations on objects. Our modern computers are also very comfortable with vectors and their parents, matrices. When we are able to represent real world objects as vectors, we can easily perform interesting tasks, such as classification, on them. For example, consider a perfect world where colors were represented as $m$-dimensional row vectors. In this perfect world, similar colors should live close togther in the $m$-dimensional space. In particular if the colors red, pink, and green were represented by vectors $r$, $p$, and $g$ then we would expect $|r-g| > |r-p|$ (to my knowledge, these types of properties do not exist for RGB color representations). Abusing notation, when I say $|r-g|$, I mean some notion of distance/similarity between the vectors $r$ and $g$ such as Euclidean distance, angle between the vectors (cosine similarity), or dot product (projection). As an illustration of this idea, the image below shows a representation of colors as 3-dimensional vectors where the vectors representing red and pink are close together and the vector representing green is much farther away.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/rpg_ex.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous motivates representing words of a natural language as vectors. Let us consider one simple way to represent words as vectors. Suppose there are $V$ words in our dictionary (or entire language), we define a $V$ dimensional space for our word vectors and represent each word as a **one-hot** vector in this space. In this representation, the first word in our dictionary is a vector of length $V$ where the first element is a $1$ and the rest of the elements are $0$'s. The $i$-th word is also a vector of length $V$ where the $i$-th element is a $1$ and the rest of the elements are $0$'s. Since there are $V$ words, each word has a unique vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_1 = [1, 0, 0, ...]$$\n",
    "$$w_2 = [0, 1, 0, ...]$$\n",
    "$$w_V = [0, 0,  ... 1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this type of representation is that all the distances between words are the same! Our reasonable notion that similar words are close to each other is not maintained in this setup. How can we encode this notion in the vector representation of words? We could hand engineer it... but we are definitely too lazy to do that for the hundreds of thousands of English words. Instead, we will try to use data (in the form of real, natural language sentences -called a **corpus**) to transform the one-hot representation into a more useful representation called an **embedding**."

    "## Word embeddings\n",
    "A family of popular word embedding techniques called **word2vec** were invented and patented by researchers at Google. The research paper prepared by the group (Mikolov et al.) is available online on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781). We will discuss the main results of this paper in detail, specifically continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-grams, although newer embedding techniques such as Global Vectors (GloVe) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have more recently been introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learned word embeddings, or continuous vector representations, of words often leverage context to determine the relationships between words. The idea is that the meaning of a given word is defined by the context in which it most often appears in. This is most easily understood by observing that when a person encounters a new or unfamiliar word, s/he often asks for the *context*. Similarly, we expect that a representation that is able to represent the context of words will also capture other desired properties of a word embedding. In the context of machine learning, the model can be asked to create an embedding that:\n",
    "1. given a word $w_t$'s context $w_{t-j}, ... w_{t-1}, w_{t+1},...w_{t+j}$ with window size $j$, predict $w_t$ (CBOW).\n",
    "2. given a word $w_t$, predict its context $w_{t-j}, ... w_{t-1}, w_{t+1},...w_{t+j}$ with window size $j$ (skip-gram).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the text \"the cat in the hat sat on the mat\" and suppose we are interested in a limited window of context of size 2 around each center word. The following table shows examples of possible center words and their associated context words:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Context (-2) | Context (-1) | Center | Context (+1) | Context (+2) |\n",
    "| ------------ | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n",
    "| the | cat | ___in___ | the | hat |\n",
    "| cat | in | ___the___ | hat | sat |\n",
    "| in | the | ___hat___ | sat| on |\n",
    "| the | hat | ___sat___ | on | the |\n",
    "| hat | sat | ___on___ | the | mat |\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn word embeddings, the model may be asked to use context words to predict center words or to use the center word to predict context words. By predict, we mean the model gives high probability (using the softmax function described later) to specific words.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss in detail both of these methods in the following. Let us begin by describing some notation to make our lives easier. We denote the $t$-th word in the corpus as $w_t$. In the standard word2vec formulation, there are two vector representations of a word: its representation as a \"center\" word denoted by $v_{w_t}$ and its representation as a context (or non-center) word $u_{w_t}$. These vector representations are of dimension $d << V$ where $d$ is a hyperparamter. Realistically, there is no clear guidance on how to choose $d$ but several standard values have emerged around 100-999. The word2vec model is trained by maximizing the probability of words appearing together in the corpus using the well established method of maximum likelihood -this probability is denoted by $p(w_{t+j} | w_t)$. The model converts its output (a dot product) into a probability distribution over words using the softmax function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(w_O | w_I) = \\frac{exp(v_{w_O}^T v_{w_I})}{\\sum_{x=1}^V{exp(v_{w_x}^T v_{w_I})}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of these two word embedding methods are two very important matrices. The two matrices $W^1$ and $W^2$ are of size $V \\times d$ and $d \\times V$. You will notice that the two matrices are the same size and that there is a row (or column) for each word in the vocabulary. These matrices contain the word embeddings we are interested in. Why do we need two separate embeddings for each word? This is purely for mathematical convenience, one embedding is for the word when it appears as a center word and one embedding is for the word when it appears as a context word. Through backpropagation and gradient descent, the matrices are adjusted to maximize the objective we will discuss later. After training is complete, we expect the rows of $W^1$ and columns of $W^2$ to contain the embedding for each word with the properties we are interested in. For use in downstream tasks (such as sentiment classification) the two embeddings for each words are typically summed together to form a single embedding for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having set some notation, we will describe details of CBOW and then skip-gram. For further reference, see the excellent explanation in [Xin Rong's writeup](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738.pdf)."

    "## Continuous bag of words\n",
    "The continuous bag of words (CBOW) word embeddings are learned by attempting to predict a word by its context. The input to the network used to learn the embedding are $C$ \"context\" words, I will call these words $x_1, x_2, ... x_C$.  The output of the network is a distribution over all the words in the vocabulary. The following illustration is commonly used to summarize the setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/cbow.png\" style=\"height: 300px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this illustraion, we see that the one hot encodings of the context words are used to retrieve the embeddings and combine them into the hidden layer. The hidden layer representation is then multiplied by $W^2$ (aka $W'$ in the figure) to get a score for each word in the vocabulary. The scores are normalized to form a probability distribution over the vocabulary using the softmax function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, the parameters of this network are the matrices $W^1$ and $W^2$ and all operations are linear except the softmax. The network is asked to maximize $p(w_O | w_I)$. This is done by minimizing the negative log likelihood of $p(w_O | w_I)$. The log operation is used for numerical stability since small numbers are hard to deal with and the quantity is minimized by convention. \n",
    "\n",
    "In  order to compute the loss, we first show the intermediate steps used to calculate the output of the network. For each center word during training, the current representation of each context word is fetched from the matrix $W^1$ by exploiting the one-hot vectors $x_1, x_2,... x_C$. Precisely, the representation of the $k$-th context word $h_k$ is retrieved by $h_k = x_k W^1$. The representations of each context word are averaged together to form one vector $h = \\frac{1}{C}(\\sum_{k=1}^C{h_k})$ -this is purely a choice made out of convenience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, a vector of scores $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{V}$ for each word is computed: $u = h W^2$. Each score $u_i$ is the dot product of $h$ and the vector representation for each word contained in $W^2$: $u_i = h v_i$. The softmax over the vector $u$ converts the real valued vector into a probability vector $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = \\frac{exp(u_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^V{exp(u_j)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss is then given by: $ E = -\\sum_{i=1}^V{t_i \\log{y_i}} $ where $t$ is the true label vector (all zeros except $1$ at the index of the center word).\n",
    "\n",

    "This figure (a visualization from a previous run) shows the location of 500 words from the vocabulary in a two dimensional projection of the original embedding space. We do not expect to fully visualize what the embeddings represent in this space, but we can make observations about the relative location of words we expect to be related. For example, around the location (x=-30,y=-5) we see the words \"first\", \"second\", and \"third\" clustered together - indicating the embedding captures the similar role these words play. Also, around (x=-5,y=-40) the words \"should\", \"could\", \"must\", \"may\", \"can\", and \"will\" are tightly packed. Similarly, \"have\", \"had\", \"has\", and \"having\" are centered around (x=10,y=-35) despite the fact that the model is not given any information about the spelling of the words. A different kind of relationship is captured around (x=-30,y=20) with words relating to nationality and country of origin. The notion of numbers is captured aroud the center of the plot (x=0,y=0). \n",

    "In summary, this plot shows that leveraging the context in a natural language corpus can help us learn word embeddings that capture many properties of words we are interested in. However, due to the high dimensional nature of the embeddings we are unable to make any concrete statements about the word representation the embeddings capture. This poses a problem for evaluating the word embeddings - how can we compare different methods for learning word embeddings, such as CBOW or skip-gram, or even different hyperparameter settings? The answer to this comes in two forms. One form of evaluation, so called \"extrinsic evaluation\", can give a measure of the effectiveness of an embedding by testing it on a real-world task (such as sentiment classification or question answering). However, this is often expensive and time-consuming. Another form of evaluation, \"intrinsic evaluation\", applies the word embedding to a simple task believed to be related to word embedding quality, such as analogy completion (asking the model to complete the analogy A is to B as C is to what?). Intrinsic evaluation is usually faster to compute and useful for quickly iterating on a model but does not always guarantee better performance on the downstream task. Thus, there is a tradeoff between intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluations when tuning a model that is usually best handled using a combination of both. See this [writeup](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/lecture_notes/notes2.pdf) for more discussion on this topic."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this article, we explored the world of learned word embeddings. We saw how using context in a large natural language corpus, machine learning models can learn to embed words as dense vectors in a space (with a dimension of our choosing). Furthermore, we observed that the resulting embeddings have many properties we are interested in, such as representing relationships between words effectively and even capturing analogical reasoning in some cases. The embeddings for words are very useful in other natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment classification, as we will see in future articles."
